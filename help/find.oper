FIND [-l num] pattern
-l num  - list max <num> amounts of lines (20 by default)
pattern - pattern to search for.
  
find searches thru the service logfiles for lines matching
"pattern". find recognizes '*' or '%' as wildcards in the
pattern.
  
find is a user friendlier interface to GREP. it escapes any
character in "pattern" that has special meaning to GREP and
ignores upper/lower case distinctions during comparisons.
