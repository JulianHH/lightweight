To make lightweight you'll need GNU make. (http://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

Additional software may be required on some systems:

PCRE  -	http://www.pcre.org/
ZLIB  - http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
MYSQL -	http://www.mysql.org/

Ie. for Debian installs the libraries as well as their respective -dev counterparts.
