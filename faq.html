Lightweight (L) FAQ

<p>
Q: What is L?
<br>
A: L is a new channel service on QuakeNet. It is similiar to Q in many ways, but different on some areas too. [See Strutsi's L manual.]


<p>
Q: How can I get L?
<br>
A: All you have to do to get L is to request it from the L-request page. This works pretty much as with the Q-request page, with the major difference that L requests do not have to be verified by us, it'll be added automatically and instant.


<p>
Q: Does this mean that I can get L to any channel that I want?
<br>
A: Yes, any channel you are an op on.


<p>
Q: But why wont L join my channel then?
<br>
A: To get L to a channel you must be a verified op on the channel. This basically means that you have to have been an op on the channel for 30 minutes atleast. The QuakeNet chanfix service will have registered you as a regular op then (thanks to EFNet for the excellent idea to this service). As a sidenote we also have to stress again that you MUST report takeovers quickly due to this rule. We'll still have some data to go after after 30 minutes, but reporting a takeover fast to #feds/#help is imperative to ensure that.


<p>
Q: Do I need to create a new account in L to use it?
<br>
A: No. The account you have in Q will be duplicated to L. You will still only have to auth to Q, Q will then tell L that you authed as the username you have. So if you allready have your Q auth in perform, L will know about you too.


<p>
Q: How is L different from Q?
<br>
A: L has the most important features from Q which involves opping, deopping and clearing channels. The features that it does not have are: banning, welcome messages, topic preservation. The reason that these features has not been implemented into L is to keep it light on resources (hence the name lightweight), and make it able to be on all channels requested.


<p>
Q: What is this chanfix you keep mumbling about?
<br>
A: Chanfix is a functionality built into one of our allready existing service which regularly looks at all the channels on QuakeNet and records who has ops. That way we'll be better to determine who has right to a certain channel. This holds both for whom should have ops if the channel becomes opless, but also who should be able to request L to the channel.


<p>
Q: How can I use this smart chanfix thingie?
<br>
A: For now the functionality is limited to be used by the L request page, and to the operators to solve takeovers. The functionality may be partially opened to the normal user later.


<p>
Q: L says I cant be added to anymore channels? WTF have you broken now?
<br>
Q: L says I cant add anymore users to my channel? WTF have you broken now?
<br>
A: As per design L is resourcelight. This means that we've put limitations on how many resources every user can use, so each user can not be known on more than X (currently 20) channels at a time, and each channel can not have flags for more than Y users at a time (currently 30). These limitations have been made so that 99% of the QuakeNet population shouldnt be bothered. For people who needs to run really large channels Q is still available.


<p>
Q: What ultracool people made this service?
<br>
A: David Mansell (splidge) and Raimo Nikkilä (strutsi) where the main coders on the project. It was started by me, Rasmus Have (MnO-Bigfoot), in Fredrik (froo) Söderblom's kitchen over a glass of whisky during opermeet.se february 02. Vincent Sweeney (Zarjazz) was supportive coder, and he runs the cvs its in. Valuable input was recieved from a lot of people on QuakeNet such as #linux, the helpers, the opers and dev-com. David Mansell, Raimo Nikkilä, Rasmus Have and Vincent Sweeney hold copyright of this project.


<p>
Q: WTF SI 1337! HOW TO BECOME SUCH A 1337 H4X0R??!??
<br>
A: I drink my milk everyday and wear my afdb.


<p>
Q: I would like to have L on my own network, can I?
<br>
A: Sure. Lightweight is released under the GPL. The sources are available from cvs. See http://cvs.quakenet.org/. Please mail contributions/ideas/patches to bigfoot, splidge or strutsi at quakenet.org.
