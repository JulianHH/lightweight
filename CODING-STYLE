---

  [1] File Format
  ---------------

  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES COMMIT FILES IN DOS FORMAT!


---

  [2] Source File Layout
  ----------------------

  All source files (*.c) should contain the following text:

/*******************************************************************************
 *
 * lightweight - a minimalistic chanserv for ircu's p10-protocol
 *
 * copyright 2002 by Rasmus Have & David Mansell
 *
 * $Id: CODING-STYLE,v 1.3 2002/03/17 19:05:26 zarjazz Exp $
 *
 *******************************************************************************/

*/

#include <lightweight.h>
    .
    .
  <BODY>
    .
    .

---

  [3] Header File Layout
  ----------------------

  All header files (*.h) should contain the following text (replacing <FILENAME>
  with the name of the header eg ACCOUNTSDB):

/*

*/

/* $Id: CODING-STYLE,v 1.3 2002/03/17 19:05:26 zarjazz Exp $ */

#ifndef __<FILENAME>_H
#define __<FILENAME>_H

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
    .
    .
  <BODY>
    .
    .
#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif

#endif /* __<FILENAME>_H */


---

  [4] Including Header Files
  --------------------------

  No header file should include any other header file (with the exception of 'lightweight.h')

  Any global / common used system header files should be placed in 'lightweight.h'

  Always include header files using #include <file.h> NOT #include "file.h". This makes a
  reordering of the file structure layout at a later date easier.
